(This file contains a subset of the variables in the file nls_panel10, expressed in terms of deviations from individual means.)

	lw_dev 	  = ln(wage/GNP deflator) - average of [ln(wage/GNP deflator)] for the i-th individual
	exp_dev	  = total work experience - average of [total work experience] for the i-th individual
	exp2_dev  = square of total work experience - average of [total work experience squared] for the i-th individual		ten_dev	  = job tenure, in years - average of [job tenure] for the i-th individual
	ten2_dev  = job tenure squared - average of [job tenure squared] for the i-th individual
	union_dev = 1 (if union memeber) or 0 (if not union member) - average of 1's and 0's for i-th individual
