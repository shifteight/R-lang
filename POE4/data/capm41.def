* February 17, 2011. In the original capm data files, in all formats, the risk free 
                   rate was based on 30-day T-bill, but it was an annual yield. 
                   It has been, effective February 17, 2011, has been changed to the correct monthly rate. 
                   The definition file capm.def also explains this. 
                   Thanks to Jeffrey Parker, and his students, at Reed College for pointing this out
